/COM,ANSYS RELEASE Release 17.2      BUILD 17.2      UP20160718       20:21:27

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.656   TIME= 20:21:28
 Using 1 iteration per substep may result in unconverged solutions for   
 nonlinear analysis and the program may not indicate divergence in this  
 case.  Check your results.                                              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.734   TIME= 20:21:28
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.797   TIME= 20:21:29
 MPC184 elements are being used in the current analysis and the          
 NLGEOM,ON command has not been used.  Thus, only linearized behavior    
 will be considered.  If finite rotation and large deflection effects    
 are to be considered, please use the NLGEOM,ON command.                 

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.797   TIME= 20:21:29
 The sparse solver must be used if any current technology elements with  
 u-P formulation or MPC184 elements using Lagrangian multiplier are      
 included in the model.  The equation solver option has been switched    
 to the sparse solver.                                                   

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.016   TIME= 20:21:29
 Material number 82 (used by element 50611 ) should normally have at     
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.109   TIME= 20:21:29
 Overconstraint may occur for Lagrange multiplier or MPC based contact   
 algorithm.                                                              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.109   TIME= 20:21:29
 Boundary conditions, coupling, and/or constraint equations have been    
 applied on certain contact nodes (for example 13921).                   

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       4.516   TIME= 20:21:30
 Multiple constraints have been applied on degree of freedom 2 of        
 contact node 5942.  The program will remove certain internal MPCs.      
 Please check the model carefully.                                       

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       7.938   TIME= 20:21:34
 Pivoting has been activated for the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver .  
 The memory required may greatly exceed the predicted amount.  In that   
 event, use the DSPOPTION command to change the memory mode and/or       
 memory size used by the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver.
